						Hello, my name is actually Samantha Petty. I am in a dreadful situation right now… oh wait, 
						I didn’t tell you about myself. I am a 19 year-old girl, well, a Southern Belle. 
						I have recently moved to the North where I am to be engaged with a wealthy man whose 
						father owns a large plantation, but I despise all of it. My father had passed away a 
						long time ago, and we had to sell our plantation in the South to stay alive. My mother 
						has forced me to marry a rich man for the sake of our survival, but I hate this man. He 
						is a greedy man who has divorced with many other young girls, and I have dignity. My plan 
						is to run away from this town before our engagement. I do not want to work in the mills until 
						an official marriage. I also don’t like sitting around and letting slaves do everything, I want 
						to become an inventor. I have seen many inventions before, and I want to create something just 
						as wonderful. My brothers, who are wealthy but stingy plantation owners barely give me and my 
						mother any money at all (I am over exaggerating, they give us plenty of money) I have not 
						eaten anything for three days in hopes to save money, and I am trying to find a place to 
						buy a ticket for a train to go to the west. I hope I can find one.

						I have found a ticket to go to the west. It will be much harder work there. In the North, we 
						have many factories, and many people in those factories doing repetitive work. I do not 
						know how bad it is but some acquaintances I made said that it was very stressful and hard. 
						There is also pollution here because of the many factories producing large amounts of smoke. 
						The smoke is very hard to get used to when you’re from the south. It will be better to go to 
						the west. I hear that the west is the newest part of the U.S., so it’s mostly farmers there. 
						If I go there, I can think of ways that they could improve, and maybe make a new invention that 
						would revolutionize the way people do things! Oh, I’m sorry for sounding so childish, but people 
						can dream. Until then, I will have to wait till I get there. I will also need to find someone 
						that I could work for. Those small details don’t really bother me as much though, I will be free 
						from my cursed fate. The train will arrive soon, I wonder what it’s like with a less dense population.

					<p>
						I have reached Ohio, oh, I forgot to mention that I was just in New York. I apologize for forgetting 
						so many important details. Also, just in New York is the wrong term. It took six weeks for me to get 
						from New York! I didn’t take the train the entire way, so I thought it was a pretty fast ride for the 
						distance. Mainly, there is a certain individual that you know of that I don’t want finding me. These 
						steam engines are amazing! Mr Watt created the first usable locomotive in the U.S., but I can’t say 
						for sure… most men don’t want us to get too smart, I am referring to my two brothers. Anyways, I can’t 
						dwell on my misfortunes if I want to succeed. I found a farmer that I was able to work for. He’s a nice 
						and humble man who left the south to start a new life. I’ll be able to make some money, but I'll have to 
						deal with him barely escaping debts with soft money. That is inflated cash, and the North is the only place 
						that likes hard money, they want gold. Well, I won’t be writing for some time, because I’m doing labor 
						work and learning how some of these machines work.

						It is my 21st birthday today and my second year of working at the farm. It is very hard for me because I have 
						big dreams but little money and I’m getting really used to the farm work, I can’t even think of how it could 
						improve. Well, I guess that will be it for this blog, it was a little short… -What is that! I smell smoke. I 
						never imagined this would happen, but there is a fire. I rush outside the house and stare in horror. I now have 
						lost my job. All the crops have been burned down. I’m certain of that. The crops didn’t just catch the fire, they 
						were burned down, as well as the house. I quickly scan the perimeter, but no one other than the farmer is here. 
						I know who it was. Hubert Odell. Oh, I never mention who he was. He is the man I was supposed to get engaged to 
						two years ago. I completely forgot about him. He has came back and gave a warning message. I don’t know what horrible 
						things he thinks or what he thinks I have done. I have some money left. I don’t know how he found me. I must have left 
						my receipt of my train ticket at my previous abode. I must be careful next time. Although I must escape, I still want 
						to have some enjoyment. I hear that the Erie canal is a good place to see. Maybe I’ll take a steamboat and go back to 
						the North. I hate the south. They believe in slaves doing the labor. That is just terrible. How many inventors were there 
						that died of working under bad conditions. Those people are labeled as property. How would they feel if they were slaves! 
						This is why the South doesn’t want internal improvements. They just want to keep their slaves, and they are monsters.

					<p>
						I’m sorry my previous blog ended so suddenly. I’ll try not to be too biased just in case you are someone new to the U.S. I 
						had to find a steamboat. It took a while, because I had to use the Ohio river before using the Erie Canal. I also didn’t have 
						time to blog because I needed money. I found this really kind factory owner, his name is Eli Billings, and I admit that I like him. 
						I am working in a factory that he built, but he gives me enough money to eat, rent a house, and even enough for savings. He is 
						truly a kind man! And he doesn’t even know about my situation. I am currently watching the Spinning Jennys and making sure that 
						there are no malfunctions. That is just the clothing section of this factory, in the other section, they are making something 
						that requires interchangeable parts. I don’t really know what they are making since I have to stay at my post and make sure that 
						everything is in working order. I know it’s dangerous, there have been reports of severed body parts, but I am not worried. The only 
						downside to this is the amount of pollution that the factory creates, if only there was a way to reduce pollution. I was caught 
						daydreaming by a higher-up. “Well, hello there Mrs. Petty, or should I say soon-to-be Mrs. Odell.” “NOOOOOOOOOOO!” I screamed as loud as I could. 
						Hubert quickly left and a bunch of workers asked what happened. I needed to get out of here. First a train, then a steamboat, I 
						went to the West and back to the North, am I never safe? I have decided to take a stagecoach to the south. I hate the south, but it seems 
						I have no other option. I will be safe near my brothers.

					<p>
						The stagecoach was a pretty bumpy ride when we got to some less developed roads. Although very long, the view was very nice and I got 
						to see many parts of America that I’ve never seen before. It was a quick ride and I reached the South. I hate looking at the 
						plantations and seeing the slaves that are forced to work there. I was also part of one of these plantations, I always gave the 
						slaves my parents owned much better treatment when no one was looking. My brothers would laugh at me, but one day they will get their 
						freedom. After walking for a while, I reached one of my brothers “homes”. “Well, if it ain’t Samantha, what brings you here little sister.” 
						“Be quiet! You didn’t help me or our mother when we needed it.” “Well, I can already tell that you are in a bad situation and you need to stay 
						here. I guess I’ll have to allow it since you’re my little sister.” He’s annoying but he is somewhat kind to at least me. I don’t know what 
						happened, did my brothers think that our mother was responsible for our father’s death? At least they are not putting the blame on each 
						other or me. The south is full of plantation owners like my brothers, but one reason that I don’t like the south is because they do not 
						want internal improvements and they are the only ones because they believe that slaves should do all the labor. Did I already mention 
						that? Well, if I did, you know by now how much it bothers me. Anyways, I need a place to stay and I’m pretty much broke, so I need 
						some more money. I need to use it more wisely. I’m a little bored here, and I feel like a southern belle, doing basically nothing 
						while to rest of America is so busy and there are so many things happening. Lately, I kept on finding myself thinking about Mr. Eli Billings. 
						I wonder if he’s single, maybe I’ll go back there, but the problem is that Hubert Odell is also there… I need a plan.

						It is time for me to do my three-day plan. I am back in the North, a little bit father from New York. My first plan is to get Hubert Odell 
						fired. I will rejoin the Eli Billing’s factory and break something when Hubert comes near and I will put the blame on him. I got enough 
						money from my brothers to eat food and stay in a cheap hotel. It’s a will be really hard to do this plan, because I need to be careful that 
						no one else is watching me when I break it, I think I’ll break a spinning jenny. Anyways, I need to get rehired, so I walk towards the 
						factory. “Hello Mrs. Petty, what brings you back here? Do you want your job back, because I’ll happily give you your job back. It’s just 
						that you’ll still have to work with Mr. Odell” “Yes, that’ll be fine. Thank you, I’ll take the job back.” The next part is easy. I go back 
						to my previous post, everything is familiar, I know the easiest way to break the spinning jenny, there is also no one here, except for- 
						“Hello Ms. Odell” I recognize that voice and I break the spinning jenny. I cry out again, just like I did last time. I cry out before anyone 
						else can talk, “This man has broke my spinning jenny! How am I supposed to work now?!” Hubert was just stunned, “Wha- she- bro-” He was immediately fired, 
						and I was now safe in Mr. Billings factory. That was a lot easier than I thought it was. I am actually surprised. I thought that it would take three 
						days to get Hubert fired, but it actually took only one day. Now I actually have a job and I don’t need to worry about anything happening to me. Yay!

						I feel like nothing exciting is going to happen after yesterday, and I really need to start saving my money, I’ve used up so much of money in the 
						past two years and not all of it was mine. I do feel like I am earning more money than the other workers, but I think that it’s best to not say 
						anything about it. I guess this is just how my life will be for the rest of my life… Well, the 4th of July is coming soon, so I guess I can plan 
						to go and see the fireworks. I’m too far away to go and see them with my mother, it will still take just as long to get to the South as before. 
						I guess that I’ll just stay here in the North, it’s not like I’m in danger or anything and we have the day off on the Fourth. It is interesting 
						how much my life has changed in two years. Now, it seems that I was never a southern belle before. I did labor work at a farm, I worked in a factory, 
						I did a lot of work which my grandmothers have probably never done before, I wonder if they even did any work at all? Times have changed so quickly, 
						maybe we will be able to vote one day, I would really love to do that. That would be impossible now though, there is nothing I can do. Life is starting 
						to get boring now. Just doing maintenance on spinning jennys.

						Tomorrow is Independence day. Nothing too special for me. I know that I should be more respectful, but I really don’t know what happened during the 
						revolution since I wasn’t there. I am grateful that we did get our Independence, but I guess this attitude comes with boredom. I really don’t know 
						if I can handle this job for the rest of my life. I was getting used to traveling everywhere and having fun. That does cost money, but I managed even 
						while I was broke, so… Just 15 min. left before our shifts are done. It’s gonna feel like forever. Fifteen minutes have passed! What? I’m blogging so 
						I can skip the boring parts, it’s boring to even write what I was doing. I guess the people that have to do this to keep themselves alive are really 
						determined, I’m really not. The parts of America are so different that it seems like completely different parts of the world. I can say that because 
						I haven’t been anywhere except the U.S., maybe it’s very different if you came from another part of the world. Before I’m able to leave the factory, 
						Eli Billings tells all the workers that he rented a flatboat for all of us to use so we can go and see the fireworks. That’s really nice of him. I still 
						kinda like him but I don’t want that to affect how this blog turns out, but it seems that my days of adventuring have come to an end.

						I just finished my work, soon we are going to go on the flatboat to go and see the fireworks in lake Erie. I’m not too excited, but I have something 
						to look forward to. I haven’t seen fireworks since I was 12, I don’t know why I had stopped watching them. I actually don’t think I remember what they 
						look like. I guess I have to thank Mr. Billings for what he’s done, I also think he likes me because I can tell that he also wanted to get rid of Hubert 
						but he couldn’t do anything like that as the head of a large company. I like him a lot, but I still want to have adventures and excitement, so I don’t think 
						I’ll get married any time soon. I have ridden a steam engine, but I have never been on a flatboat before. I’ve attached a picture in this blog showing what a 
						flatboat looks like, so I won’t have to describe it and you can see it better. Ours is very spacious, and I can’t believe that I’ve never rode one before, I 
						should have at least tried it. Anyways, the boat comes to a halt, and we are told that the fireworks are about to begin. It was amazing. I start to remember 
						a lot about my childhood, but that doesn’t bother me. The fireworks are beautiful, I don’t think that I’ll ever forget them. It seemed to last forever, and 
						then Mr. Billings suddenly pulled me aside. He pulled out a small box, opened it, and asked, “I know we haven’t talked to each other that much, but I think 
						that we both really really like each other. Will you marry me?”.(This section is really cheesy and bad because I have never written a romance. I included 
						this as a part of the story because I think I finished everything that I needed to finish so I could focus on the story.) Without even thinking, I said yes, 
						but I don’t think I had any control over that. I liked Eli and I’ll be forever safe from Hubert. The final firework was huge and I don’t think that I’ll ever forget that day.
